            These are some of my projects that I hold a high regard to. Of course, they are all Minecraft, but have helped me learn a lot on how to program, plan, create, and work in teams.

                        Monumenta is an on-going successful project in Minecraft that I've been working on with many others for almost 2 years now.
                        It is an MMORPG with over 100 hours of content in it. I primarily specialize in programming the project, such as creating bosses, spells, and various system improvements/rewrites.

                        This project was more event-related and was very recent. It aimed at celebrating the life of Wynncraft, another Minecraft MMORPG, except much bigger than Monumenta.
                        I specialized in recreating the various systems of Wynncraft, all of which turned out to be extremely accurate and debatably more efficent and better performing than Wynncraft's actual
                        systems.

                        Spellforged PvP was my most personal and biggest Minecraft project, as it was entirely planned and built from the ground up, primarily by myself and with the help of friends.
                        The premise was to battle others in a Free-For-All arena or in team-based matches using unique classes, all with over 30+ spells in their toolkit to mix and match.
                        However, it unfortunately did not yield a very high player count due to the lack of advertising, and thus could no longer stay alive and was shut down.
