                                                Equipping an Offhand Item: <b>Place it in your Offhand Slot manually via your Inventory.</b>

                                                Offhanding in Minecraft is an underappreciated mechanic.
                                                We intend to make it both useful and important by implementing <b>Dual-Wielding</b> and <b>Shields</b> into PROJECT Spellforged.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <b>Dual-Wielding</b> allows you to attack with 2 weapons in both your Mainhand and your Offhand. You can swing with your Offhand by Right Clicking, and certain Game Options allow you to switch that up if you're not a fan of it.
                                                This allows you to experience melee combat in a unique way, and makes certain weapons such as Daggers - weak in damage but swift in speed - especially viable.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <b>Shields</b> are present in PROJECT Spellforged, remade in a way to fit a proper RPG. Use Shields to defend against powerful attacks, or to push back with special Shield Skills that
                                                can be used to counter these attacks. Shields are especially good for a Tanking role in your party, so it is advised for you to use one if you intend to hold the line within your Party.

                                                Movement can be a large reason of why combat is fun and intense. Some enemy attacks may need both speed and reaction time in order to evade them.

                                                PROJECT Spellforged has implemented a simple, yet useful mechanic called <b>Sprint Dashing.</b> This will give you a large, yet quick-fading burst of speed when you begin sprinting. This allows you to
                                                dodge attacks faster and in a stylized manner.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Sprint Dashing isn't unlimited though, and has a short cooldown attached to it. Be sure you time it wisely, otherwise you may find yourself taking a hit you won't be able to withstand...
