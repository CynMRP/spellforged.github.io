                    PROJECT Spellforged boasts over 100 Abilities and Passives, each with their own use and upgrade path. Each one has been carefully handmade to not only feel visually powerful, but be useful in their own way.
                    <br />
                    Chain together quick Sword attacks to defeat your enemies in a flashy style, or harness the mana around you to launch magical attacks.
                    With unique combat features such as Sprint Dashing, Dual Wielding, and Shields, all players will be able to find their preferred playstyle.
                    <br />
                    Be careful however. Just how you can wield powerful skills, your foes can have even more devestating attacks...

                                                needs to be fluid, and needs a good amount of Ability Slots for you to assign them to.

                                                This system allows you to use the Swap Key (Usually keybound to F) to prime an ability cast, then press a respective keybind to activate the skill. Passives do not take up an Ability Slot.

                                                Offhanding in Minecraft is an underappreciated mechanic.
                                                We intend to make it both useful and important by implementing <b>Dual-Wielding</b> and <b>Shields</b> into PROJECT Spellforged.

                                                <b>Dual-Wielding</b> allows you to attack with 2 weapons in both your Mainhand and your Offhand. You can swing with your Offhand by Right Clicking, and certain Game Options allow you to switch that up if you're not a fan of it.
                                                This allows you to experience melee combat in a unique way, and makes certain weapons such as Daggers - weak in damage but swift in speed - especially viable.

                                                can be used to counter these attacks. Shields are especially good for a Tanking role in your party, so it is advised for you to use one if you intend to hold the line within your Party.

                                                Movement can be a large reason of why combat is fun and intense. Some enemy attacks may need both speed and reaction time in order to evade them.

                                                dodge attacks faster and in a stylized manner.
