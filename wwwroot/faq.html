                    <b><u>When will PROJECT Spellforged be released to the public?</u></b>
                    <p>
                        We aim to release nearing the end of 2021, or during the first half of 2022. No official date is confirmed yet however. PROJECT Spellforged isn't something we want to rush, and we want at least over a year of development time to plan, create, and polish our experience.
                        None of us on the team want to release an unfinished project because we had a due date to abide by.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><u>Will PROJECT Spellforged have features like Guilds and Housing?</u></b>
                    <p>
                        As of right now, features like those are not planned for official release.
                        We want to create an initial experience that contains all of our required features and prerequisites before we start adding additional features like Guilds. 
                        It doesn't mean that we don't have plans for them in the future, and in fact we want to have those. They will come in future updates however, and we need to 
                        analyze our playerbase and server load first to see what we need to make.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <b><u>What Minecraft Version will PROJECT Spellforged be hosted on?</u></b>
                    <p>
                        PROJECT Spellforged will always be hosted on the latest version of Minecraft, and as of today that version is 1.16.x Java Edition.
                        We want to use the latest version to give ourselves all of the latest resources Minecraft has to offer to build our world, and to allow players to
                        play without having to downgrade versions.

                    <b><u>How can I keep updated on PROJECT Spellforged?</u></b>
                    <p>
                        The best way you can do that is to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/jJVEYpW"><i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Discord!</a> There you can meet and converse with the team behind PROJECT Spellforged, get the latest updates about the project, and even have the chance to
                        apply to help build the project to its end.

                    <b><u>Will I get the chance to test out PROJECT Spellforged?</u></b>
                    <p>
                        When we are nearing the end of closed development, it is likely that we will have a Closed Alpha/Beta test to allow players
                        to join and test the content and systems we've made. The players that can partake in these tests will be handpicked, so not everyone will be let into the Alpha/Beta
                        experience. We do this to make sure that we squashed all the bugs, and to make sure the content and systems
                        we've made is fun and enjoyable without having to deal with a massive flood of players.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <b><u>Is PROJECT Spellforged the official name of the server?</u></b>
                    <p>
                        No, it is just the project name. We intend to decide on an official name later in the future.

                    <b><u>Who is leading the Project and what is their background?</u></b>
                    <p>
                        The person leading is me, Novalescent. I am a Developer, Game Designer, and the Project Director and one of the official Founders of PROJECT Spellforged. I've developed multiple projects and Minecraft creations that I feel confident in saying are phenomenal. You can view my
                        Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCor0GNp6L4J5NXf4_n_fSYw">here,</a> where I post most of my works, including about PROJECT Spellforged. I hope my skills and background gives you confidence about this project's success as it has done so for me.
