                        <p class="text-gray-300">
                            No official timeframe is confirmed yet. Spellforged isn't something we want to rush, and we want at least
                            over a year of development time to plan, create, and polish our experience. None of us on the team want to release an unfinished
                            project because we had a due date to abide by.

                        <p class="text-gray-300">
                            As of right now, features like those are not planned for official release. We want to create an initial experience that contains all
                            of our required features and prerequisites before we start adding additional features like Guilds. While we plan to add these features
                            in future updates, we need to analyze our playerbase and server load first to determine our priorities.

                            Spellforged will always be hosted on the latest version of Minecraft (currently 1.20.x Java Edition). We
                            want to use the latest version to give ourselves all of the latest resources Minecraft has to offer to build our world, and to allow
                            players to play without having to downgrade versions.

                            When we are nearing the end of closed development, we will have a Closed Alpha/Beta test. Testers will be handpicked to ensure
                            quality feedback and manageable server loads. This helps us identify bugs and validate that our content and systems are fun and
                            enjoyable.
