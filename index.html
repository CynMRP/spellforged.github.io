                        At base, Specializations are meant to be simplistic yet fun. However,
                        their core gameplay, playstyle, and enjoyment revolves around their more complex
                        mechanic called an <b>Awakened Technique.</b>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Awakened Techniques grant you a powerful attack or combo to unleash against your
                        enemies that feels extremely fun and satisfying to wield. Each technique has been
                        designed uniquely for each specialization, alongside their own planned upgrades to
                        enhance its power further and to synchronize between your base skills.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So, build up a barrage of windchaser shots and climax with a powerful beam as a Marksman, or
                        call
                        down a
                        legendary blade of light to wield as your own as a Paladin for a short time. Whatever you
                        choose,
                        its strength will not go unnoticed.
