                        Equipping an Offhand Item:

                      <p>
                        Offhanding in Minecraft is an underappreciated
                        mechanic. We intend to make it both useful and
                        important by implementing <b>Dual-Wielding</b> and
                        <b>Shields</b> into PROJECT Spellforged.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Dual-Wielding</b> allows you to attack with 2
                        weapons in both your Mainhand and your Offhand. You
                        can swing with your Offhand by Right Clicking, and
                        certain Game Options allow you to switch that up if
                        you're not a fan of it. This allows you to experience
                        melee combat in a unique way, and makes certain
                        weapons such as Daggers - weak in damage but swift in
                        speed - especially viable.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Shields</b> are present in PROJECT Spellforged,
                        remade in a way to fit a proper RPG. Use Shields to
                        defend against powerful attacks, or to push back with
                        special Shield Skills that can be used to counter
                        these attacks. Shields are especially good for a
                        Tanking role in your party, so it is advised for you
                        to use one if you intend to hold the line.

                        Movement can be a large reason of why combat is fun
                        and intense. Some enemy attacks may need both speed
                        and reaction time in order to evade them.

                      <p>
                        PROJECT Spellforged has implemented a simple, yet
                        useful mechanic called <b>Sprint Dashing.</b> This
                        will give you a large, quick-fading burst of speed
                        when you begin sprinting. This allows you to dodge
                        attacks faster and in a stylized manner.

                      <p>
                        Sprint Dashing isn't unlimited though, and has a short
                        cooldown attached to it. Be sure you time it wisely,
                        otherwise you may find yourself taking a hit you won't
                        be able to withstand...

                            <b>Enchantments</b> are unique empowerments of
                            your equipment. Rather than improving its stats,
                            Enchantments grant you special abilities while you
                            wear the equipment that has them. You can obtain
                            them by finding Enchantment Altars out in the
                            world, and offering specific items to enchant.
                            Equipment can only have 1 Enchantment on them at a
                            time.

                          As you fill up your Bank, you will find many types
                          of Equipment and Weapons. PROJECT Spellforged has
                          very few restrictions on equipment usage, allowing

                          There are only 2 kinds of restrictions to wearing
                          equipment: <b>Level Requirement </b>and<b>

                            <b>Level Requirement</b> attached to them. Not
                            meeting this requirement will prevent you from
                            using the equipment, and you will not gain any
                            stats from them.

                            <b>Equipment Weight</b> is a flexible system where
                            Weapons and Armor have a Weight value attached to
                            them, and each class has a preset Weapon and Armor
                            Weight maximum. These values add on whenever you
                            are using them, and going over the capacity of
                            either your Weapon Weight or Armor Weight will
                            invoke penalties. However, they don't prevent you
                            from dual-wielding heavy weapons...
