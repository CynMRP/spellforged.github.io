            Choose between 5 Classes, each with their own roles within a group,
            and dozens of abilities to choose from. Mix and match your abilities
            to create your playstyle, wield different types of weapons to fit
            the scenario, and experience a Class System that is nearly
            unlimited, yet highly in-depth.
            <br />
            Play as a Warrior and unleash powerful attacks to devestate your
            enemies, chain together quick Sword attacks as a Rogue to defeat
            your enemies in a flashy style, or study the magicks of Casters to
            devestate your enemies with either bursts of mana or forbidden dark
            magics.

            PROJECT Spellforged boasts over 100 Abilities and Passives, each
            with their own use and upgrade path. Each one has been carefully
            handmade to not only appear visually striking, but to be powerful in
            their own way.
            <br />
            These abilities are accompanied by a unique casting system, and
            intricate combat features such as Sprint Dashing, Dual Wielding, and
            Shields. All players will be able to find their preferred playstyle
            with the options presented.
            <br />
            However, your enemies can wield just as devestating attacks, from
            simple dash strikes to powerful explosions. These, you cannot take
            alone. Team up with other players to defeat these foes, and be
            blessed with lost treasures earned through your party's teamwork.

                          Offhanding in Minecraft is an underappreciated
                          mechanic. We intend to make it both useful and
                          important by implementing <b>Dual-Wielding</b> and
                          <b>Shields</b> into PROJECT Spellforged.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <b>Dual-Wielding</b> allows you to attack with 2
                          weapons in both your Mainhand and your Offhand. You
                          can swing with your Offhand by Right Clicking, and
                          certain Game Options allow you to switch that up if
                          you're not a fan of it. This allows you to experience
                          melee combat in a unique way, and makes certain
                          weapons such as Daggers - weak in damage but swift in
                          speed - especially viable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <b>Shields</b> are present in PROJECT Spellforged,
                          remade in a way to fit a proper RPG. Use Shields to
                          defend against powerful attacks, or to push back with
                          special Shield Skills that can be used to counter
                          these attacks. Shields are especially good for a
                          Tanking role in your party, so it is advised for you
                          to use one if you intend to hold the line.

                          Movement can be a large reason of why combat is fun
                          and intense. Some enemy attacks may need both speed
                          and reaction time in order to evade them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          PROJECT Spellforged has implemented a simple, yet
                          useful mechanic called <b>Sprint Dashing.</b> This
                          will give you a large, quick-fading burst of speed
                          when you begin sprinting. This allows you to dodge
                          attacks faster and in a stylized manner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Sprint Dashing isn't unlimited though, and has a short
                          cooldown attached to it. Be sure you time it wisely,
                          otherwise you may find yourself taking a hit you won't
                          be able to withstand...

                          </p>
                          <p>
                            While Weapons grant you damage output and Armor
                            improves your defenses and Attributes, Accessories
                            are a third equipment type that will allow you to
                            enhance your character in a different style.

                            playstyle depending on what you wear. Furthermore,
                            upgrading your Accessories via Refinements will
                            increase these stats to grant you more power.

                            When exploring the world, be sure to look out for
                            these kinds of items. Accessories can be crucial to
                            your playstyle depending on what you need the most.

                            give to your equipment can effectively change or
                            enhance how you play, ranging from granting you

                              stats to your desire. They convert a percentage
                              amount of a stat you select on an item into an
                              Attribute stat of your choice, allowing you to
                              specialize further into an Attribute. This is less
                              of an upgrade and more of a tuning to help turn
                              your equipment into what you want it to be.

                              Damage, an Armor piece's defensive stats, or an
                              Accessory's main stat. Equipment can be refined
                              multiple times at the cost of either Refinement

                              <b>Imbuements</b> grant your equipment additional
                              stats by imbuing it with specific materials.
                              Weapons, Armor, and Accessories can be imbued,
                              allowing you to effectively stack imbuements
                              together to become stronger.

                              Enchantments grant you special abilities while you
                              wear the equipment that has them. You can obtain
                              them by finding Enchantment Altars out in the
                              world, and offering specific items to enchant.
                              Equipment can only have 1 Enchantment on them at a
